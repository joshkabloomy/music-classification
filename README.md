# Overview
This is my research project of music genre classification through machine learning with three different neural networks.\
MFCCDemo.ipynb illustrates the preprocessing part (Preprocessor.ipynb) of converting audio data into readable MFCC data.\
Pitch_Shift.ipynb transposes the key of audio data as a data augmentation method. \
ANN, CNN, and RNN codes are optimized (training factors) to reach the highest accuracy through my testing.
I try and test out the basic structure of ANN, CNN, and RNN and end up improving the CNN model with data augmentation methods to 81.49%. 
In-depth data preprocessing and training features/processes are discussed in the paper.

# Results
